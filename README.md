# Gas-Agency-Project-Final


Overview of the Project :
We have developed a project called Bharat Gas Agency CRM tool, and included various features like gas update, booking gas cylinders, refill history, customer support, feedback and ratings, and track gas cylinder. 
It's also helpful that we have organized the project into different modules, including introduction, project layout, algorithms, and code. 
This tool includes various features that allow for efficient management of gas bookings, such as customer details, delivery agent details, and gas agency information. 
In terms of customer details, the tool captures various data points including the customer's name, address, and whether they have a gas connection. 
We utilized Java language to develop the tool and implemented interface, class objects, and methods, including the date method, to enable its functionality.
